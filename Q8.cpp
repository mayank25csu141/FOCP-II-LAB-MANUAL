//A monitoring system generates a sequence of numeric event IDs from 1 to N.
//To make logs easier to analyse, the system applies tags to certain events based on predefined rules:
// Events whose ID is divisible by 3 are tagged as “Buzz”
// Events whose ID is divisible by 5 are tagged as “Fuzz”
// Events divisible by both 3 and 5 receive both tags
